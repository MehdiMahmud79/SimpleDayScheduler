# Work Day Scheduler

```

+ It is responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

```
A simple calendar application that allows users to save events every hour of the day. Each time block is classified and indicates whether it is past, present or future. When each time block save button is triggered, the text input for that event is saved to local storage. As a busy schedule user, I want you to add important events to your notebook so you can manage your time more efficiently.
